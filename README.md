## Structure of my HA's config

I learned a lot by watching [Franck Nijhof on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/Frenck) and his [GitHub repo](https://github.com/frenck/home-assistant-config). So splitted my config in differents .yaml files so it's easier to navigate between every integratgions et automations
