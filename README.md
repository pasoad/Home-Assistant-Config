# My Home Assistant config

First of all, i'm not a dev. So i'm prety sure they are a lot of mistakes for dev but maybe it can help someone one day :)

## Structure of my HA's config

I learned a lot by watching [Franck Nijhof on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/Frenck) and his [GitHub repo](https://github.com/frenck/home-assistant-config). So splitted my config in differents .yaml files so it's easier to navigate between every integratgions et automations
